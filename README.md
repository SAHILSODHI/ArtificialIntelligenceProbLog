# ArtificialIntelligenceProbLog
Probabilistic Datalog Engine

Designed and implemented a probabilistic datalog engine in Java. The system supports both naive and semi-naive evaluation methods, to extract new facts(with uncertainties) from the fact database and set of rules.

Semantics of Problog: Problog, a database query language based on the logic programming paradigm, is described. The syntax and semantics of Problog and its use for querying a relational database are presented. Optimization methods for achieving efficient evaluations of Problog queries are classified, and the most relevant methods are presented.
